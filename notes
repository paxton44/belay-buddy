form 
create account 
from submit button
login button 
redirect to login page


i need to know what to do for my form. i believe i will be making a post after the user finishes filling out the create profile form


then on the next page when i go to generate their completed user profile page, i will be making a fetch to get that same data

so i assume i need a route i will be posting the req.body to?

and what the key names should be within the object to match
